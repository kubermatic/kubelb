# Guidelines for Writing E2E Tests

## Resource creation

Use `apply` to create resources, whereever possible and duplicate resources should be moved to step templates. Only use script to create resources if it's really neccessary and can't be done easily with `apply`.

## Code duplication

Avoid code duplication. If a resource is used in multiple tests, it should be moved to a step template.

## Cleanup

Always use `finally` to cleanup resources.
